# carotid_artery_detection-_DL_model

The carotid arteries are major blood vessels in the neck that supply oxygenated blood to the brain, neck, and face.  
Internal Carotid Artery (ICA): Supplies blood to the brain.  
Found on both sides of the neck, with one artery on the left and one on the right.  
Blockages or narrowing can lead to serious conditions like stroke or clotting of blood in the brain.
Significance:
Early diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent complications.
